# Innocaption Ecommerce Application
**Tech Stack:** SQLite DB, FastAPI backend, NextJS frontend

Hi! Thanks for checking out my application. To run this app, make sure to have node package manager installed, and run:

npm i

npm start

from the root directory. This will simultaneously download dependencies, set up the python environment and SQLite database, and start up the backend and frontend.
